# Banana-Modelüçå

## About Dataset
---
Tabular dataset contains numerical information about bananas of different quality (size, weight, sweetness, softness, harvest time, ripeness, acidity, quality).

## Data Sources
[Banana Data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/l3llff/banana)

## Tools
python 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the  data to answer key questions, such as:

What is the number of good and what is the number of bad?

 What is the relationship between quality and the rest of the variables (size, weight, degree of sweetness, softness..)?
 
## Data Analysis
Include some code with python libraries like

pandas 

numpy

matplotlib 

sklearn

sklearn.metrics

sklearn.linear_model

train_test_split

## Results 

With this analysis, we were able to build a model that predicts
Quality with an accuracy of 57%.
The accuracy of the model is 57%, meaning that   correctly predicted the quality of bananas (presumably based on certain criteria) in 57% of the cases. This indicates that the model is able to make correct predictions for slightly more than half of the instances it was tested on. This indicates that there is room for improvement in the model's predictive capabilities
